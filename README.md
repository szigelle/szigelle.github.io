## WHO?
Hi! I'm a Master's Student at UW Tacoma. My favorite color is #ffb7c5. I'll be updating this page eventually to serve as a portfolio hub. https://github.com/szigelle

## WHAT?
I'm a newly hired Power Analyst at Tacoma Power, working in Long-Term Planning. My day-to-day is all things data: building models, software, visualizing data, and engineering, too!
